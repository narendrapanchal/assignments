Task: Image Capture and Display Application

Overview:
You are tasked with creating a feature-rich image capture application using React JS. This application will allow users to capture images using both the front and back cameras of their device. Additionally, users should be able to zoom in before taking a picture and select different aspect ratios for the captured images. Post capture, all images will be displayed in an elegantly designed gallery where images can be zoomed in on hover.

Objectives:
•	Implement camera functionality to capture images using both the front and back cameras.
•	Incorporate zoom in functionality for the camera interface.
•	Allow users to alter the aspect ratio of the camera to predefined settings ( e.g., 16:9, 4:3, 1:1 ).
•	Develop a UI/gallery to display the captured images.
•	Implement zoom in functionality on hover over the images in the gallery.

Requirements:

Camera Capture:
•	Implement a toggle feature to switch between the front and back cameras.
•	Provide buttons or controls for the user to zoom in/out before capturing the image.

Aspect Ratio:


•	Offer a selection of aspect ratios (16:9, 4:3, 1:1) for the user to choose from before taking a photo.
•	The camera view should update in real-time based on the selected aspect ratio.

Image Gallery:


•	After images are captured, display them in a responsive gallery layout.
•	Implement hover effects to zoom in on images within the gallery.

Advanced Features (Optional):


•	Implement the ability to delete images from the gallery.

Technical Considerations:


•	The application should be responsive and work across different devices and screen sizes.
•	Pay attention to the user experience, especially the transitions between camera and gallery views.
